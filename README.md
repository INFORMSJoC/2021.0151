The software in this repository is a snapshot of the software that was used in the research reported on in the paper [Learning Equilibria in Asymmetric Auction Games](tbd) by Martin Bichler, Stefan Heidekr√ºger ([@heidekrueger](https://github.com/heidekrueger)), Nils Kohring ([@kohring](https://github.com/kohring)). The snapshot is based on the `bnelearn` software library, and corresponds to [this release](https://github.com/heidekrueger/bnelearn/releases/tag/v1.1.0) in the development repository. 

**Important:** The underlying `bnelearn` software is being developed on an on-going basis at 
https://github.com/heidekrueger/bnelearn/. Please go there if you would like to get a more recent version or would like support. The documentation of the `bnelearn` software can be found at https://bnelearn.readthedocs.io/.

## Description

The goal of this software is to demonstrate the demonstration of the empirical convergence behavior of the NPGA algorithm in asymmetric auction games. Please see the paper for details.

## Requirements and setup

To install the software and it's requirements, please follow the instructions at https://bnelearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/installation.html. The specific requirements for this snapshot of the code can also be found [here](bnelearn/docs/usage/installation.rst). 

## Results

The following table presents all asymmetric sealed-bid auctions were we successfully deployed the equilibrium learning algorithm with references to the corresponding sections in the IJOC article and in the code.
